# 🛣️ Road Lane Detection Using Python and OpenCV
This project implements a real-time lane detection system using Python, OpenCV, and NumPy. It processes video frames to detect road lanes using edge detection, region masking, and Hough line transformation. Ideal for self-driving car simulations, computer vision practice, or academic projects.
